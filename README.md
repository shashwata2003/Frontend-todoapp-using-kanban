Vetting Project for the role of Frontend engineer intern at mercor.
In this project, I have cloned a Figma design in React. The deployed code is replicated the original Figma design, including fonts, icons, colors, structure, layout, and spacing. 
This is the Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/Paz2INbKkXCSR0Tqb9cmPF/Mercor-Project
